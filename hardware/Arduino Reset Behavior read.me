The 0.47mf "reset capacitor" stops the Arduino from being reset when the USB port is fist queried.

Without the capacitor, the Raspberry Pi would reset the Arduino on boot, which would kill the power.

This also blocks the Arduino IDE from resting the Arduino to upload sketches.

Socketing the Arduino, so that it can be removed for programming, is one option.

There are also ways to hit the Arduino reset button and then upload the sketch, you'll need to Goolge for instructions.
